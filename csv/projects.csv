Detective.io,https://github.com/jplusplus/detective.io,Nov 2013,Aug 2015,,,Detective.io was a network analysis tool as well as a data management tool for journalists. A user could define an ontology (i.e describe his or her area of study) and store information on the topic. Think of it as Silk.co meets Kumu.io. The positioning was too complex and we built too much code before we realized it.,Wrong market positionning,"3,608",7,71,8
Feowl,https://github.com/jplusplus/feowl,Sept 2012,Oct 2013,,,"Feowl was a network of contributors who used SMS to report on power outages in Douala, Cameroon. The prototype worked well, but we lacked a liaison team on location, as well as further funding.",Lack of a liaison team in Douala,385,5,0,4
Dataplayer,https://github.com/jplusplus/dataplayer,Apr 2013,June 2013,,,"Dataplayer was a presentation tool, a bit like Slid.es. Users would fill out a JSON file to describe the animations and Dataplayer did the magic. It was too cumbersome for tech-savvy people and too complex for lay persons.",Too complicated for non-technical users,190,2,0,3
Alerte Politique,,,,,,"AlertePolitique was a mobile app that gave you long-term election results for any of the 36,000 French communes. It could also send you an alert when you entered a commune where a political party had an average score over a certain threshold. Updating the app after each election was too much work given the meagre revenues it generated.",Unprofitable,,,,3
Broken Promises,https://github.com/jplusplus/broken-promises,Oct 2013,Jan 2014,,http://brokenpromises.jplusplus.org/images/logo.png,"Broken Promises scanned the archives of several news organizations to spot predictions, such as a 1995 announcing something for 2015. It worked brilliantly but requires to much computing power. Without funding, we had to take it down.",Server costs were too high,118,5,0,6
