",Detective.io was a network analysis tool as well as a data management tool for journalists. A user could define an ontology (i.e describe his or her area of study) and store information on the topic. Think of it as Silk.co meets Kumu.io.

It could also send you an alert when you entered a commune where a political party had an average score over a certain threshold. Updating the app after each election was too much work given the meagre revenues it generated.",Unprofitable,,,,3
Broken Promises,https://github.com/jplusplus/broken-promises,2013,2014,assets/images/broken_promises.png,,#004284,"Broken Promises scanned the archives of several news organizations to spot predictions, such as a 1995 announcing something for 2015.
